# Push_swap
Push Swap is a sorting algorithm project in which the goal is to sort a list of integers using a minimal number of operations between two stacks.
# Operations allowed
- Push (Push first number of stack a to the top of stack b or the other way around)
- Swap (The 2 first numbers of a stack)
- Rotate (First number of the stack goes to the bottom of the stack)
- Revers (Last number of the stack goes to the top of the stack)
# Goal
- Sort 5 numbers in less than 12 operations
- Sort 100 numbers in less than 700 operations
- Sort 500 numbers in less than 5500 operations
